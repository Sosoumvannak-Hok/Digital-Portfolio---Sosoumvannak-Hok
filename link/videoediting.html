                    <p>As a final project in my first year of Video Production, I had to get into a team to produce a movie swede, a reenactment of a movie scene using no budget whatsoever. My team and I decided doing a scene from Rush Hour 3 called "He is Mi and I am Yu". We thought it was going to be a fun and easy assignment, but it became tough once we were doing the actual production. Each of us had to take on more than one role; I was the director, actor, and video editor. We also had to gather props that were free for us to grab, and it was a struggle. After the production, the final edit of the swede was submitted to my instructor and at the end of the year, my team and I received an award for best swede. It was a funny video to laugh at, and it most accurately mirrored the actual scene in Rush Hour 3. After that, I have gained experience in all the stages of video production.</p>

                    <p>During the winter season and my second year of Video Production, I was assigned a team to do a sport video with for my school. The Girls' Varsity Basketball team needed a video showcasing them in a positive way for their sports award ceremony. Me and my team planned out how the video was going to be, when to record, and who was going to edit the video. The hardest aspect of the job was to schedule the time and place of where we were supposed to be. We had the time for their games and practices, but we had busy schedules of our own, so staying up late was frequent for us. After the completion of the sport video, it was checked off by my instructor and it received the green light to be presented in the sports award. From that point forward, I've learned how to provide video contact and manage busy scheduling.</p>
