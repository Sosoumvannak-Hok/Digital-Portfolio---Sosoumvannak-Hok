                <h1>Hi!</h1>
                <p>My name is Sosoumvannak Hok and I am a student at Sunnyside High and the Center for Advanced Research and Technology in Fresno, California. I have a dream to become a developer in creative content, whether it is on development work or design. I have a strong passion in the field of interactive media and I am ambitious to pursue a career in the creative industry.</p>
                <p>Take my education in a serious manner, enrolling in classes that were most relevant in the career I am pursuing. I have engaged in Web Application Development and Video Production classes, building a strong foundation in both subjects. Whenever I have free time, I use it to practice my craft, learn something new, or enjoy my personal interests.</p>
                <p>Ever since I was a kid, I’ve enjoyed playing video games, watching anime/TV shows, and reading about fantasy. My hobbies inspired me to pursue a career in the field of creative media. This website that I had created is the representation of my development work.</p>
                <p>I welcome you to my website and thank you for the time you have spent. I hope you have gain an understanding of who I am and if so, you may contact me and I will reach out whenever possible.</p>
                <p>Cheers,</p>
                <p>Sosoumvannak Hok</p>
