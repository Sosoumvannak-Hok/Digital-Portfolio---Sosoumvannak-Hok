        <text>While I was taking Web Development classes, I've received an assignment to experiment with CSS on a given HTML prompt. "CSS Zen Garden" is a website dedicated to CSS-based design where anyone could use their HTML code to create custom designs for it. I used Brackets as my text editor and w3schools.com as my reference tool. I've learned so much more about CSS after completing the assignment, creating a website design that I thought was too complex for me to do. I had encountered some situations where the reference tool I was using alone wasn't enough to cope with my design. I managed to get the design I was looking for through research on the Web, where there was tons of information on CSS design. Since then, my design skills for web pages have improved strikingly.</text>
