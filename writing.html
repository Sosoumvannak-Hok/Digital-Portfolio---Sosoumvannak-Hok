                    <p>"Survive Cambodia" is a short story about my father's past during the Cambodia genocide. This was produced as an assignment for my English II GATE class. The specifications for the assignment was to create a short story about cultural conflict. The story can be based on historical events or be fictional. I had to use creative imaginary through words as well as give the story an emotional impact to the reader.  "Survive Cambodia” is both a creative and academic work, for my school and for anyone who want to read about my father's terrifying past. I've chosen my short story to be displayed on my website because of how important it is to me. My father survived a genocide and I want my short story to be based upon it, hoping others would read about it as well.</p>

                    <p>Ready Player One in the English Curriculum is an argument about why public schools should implement the novel Ready Player One in English courses. This was produced as an essay for my English 11 class. The specifications for this essay was to state an argument about the topic within 50 minutes. I’ve managed to create the argument in five paragraphs, including a complete introduction, body, and conclusion. This is used for academic purposes, considering the involvement of public school’s learning curriculum. The sample picture is just one out of the 3 pages of the essay and it is formatted MLA style. I’ve chosen this argument to be displayed on my website because I agree on what I wrote. I believe Ready Player One would be an absolute wonder for students to read.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">April 1975, it all happened in just a blink of an eye. The Khmer Rouge seized control of Cambodia, and I was just a poor farmer boy at the time. The Khmer Rouge was a Communist organization known for being extremists and killing those who were educated. As a child, I didn’t know why they were after us, killing us, torturing us, and imprisoning us. We were the same as them in almost every way: same culture, same race, but different positions in life.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">As Communist soldiers were banging on the door, I was held tightly by mother and father, crying in fear in their arms. The same goes with my four younger siblings, all scared as much as I was. We were all huddled up at the corner of the room, which didn’t really do much but it was all that we can do.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“CRASH!” the door goes, as two Communist soldiers barged in, with their rifles pointing at us, as they look at us with cold, dead eyes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“Please don’t kill us! Please don’t kill us! Please don’t kill us!” my mother screams, holding us tighter in her arms.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“Please, you don’t have to do this!” my father yelled, “Have mercy on our poor lives!”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“Who’s the eldest child?” the soldier on the left said with silences afterwards. The soldier on the right shoots one bullet at the ground in front of us and yelled “Answer us, or we’ll shoot!” Mother and father said nothing, to not put me, the eldest child, at the hands of ruthless people.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“One…” The left soldier began counting. “Two…” We were on the verged of death, but I finally stood up and answered “Me, it’s me! I’m the eldest child! Take me! Please just don’t hurt my family!” The two soldiers lowered their rifles.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">As I stand to be taken by Communist hands, my mother and father couldn’t let go of my arm. One of the soldiers then pulled me out of there and tied my hands together.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“Sophal!” mother yelled, as she witness me; her first-born child separated from the family.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“Big brother, please don’t go!” said Dolly, my little sister, who loved everyone in our family.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">I did not look back at them. I did not look at the faces of my family as I leave with the soldiers, knowing that there’s a possibility of me getting shot for turning my back around.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">I left the house with the two soldiers behind me, and then I was taken into a large truck filled with many people, all male and all the same age as me. They seem to be in the same state that I’m in right now; frightened, confused, and worried. Both soldiers ordered me to go in so I do as they said. They start up the truck and proceed on to their next destination.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">Time passes by, and everyone in the truck was still the same; all quiet, all hopeless, including me. Throughout the whole trip, I thought about my life and my family, as I was going to lose them both. I wonder, why are we being treated like cattle, why are they going against their own people, and where are they taking us?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">Even more time passes by, and we finally arrived at our destination. We have entered to what appears to be a camp right next to the fields. The two soldiers suddenly stopped the truck, jumped out, and ordered everyone inside to get out. One by one, we all got off and filed in a straight line, facing the huts.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">As we wait for something to happen, someone appeared from one of the huts. That someone was wearing a military uniform, with the Khmer Rouge symbol on his right arm and a gun. As he walks to examine us thoroughly, he looked at us with the same eyes as those of the two soldiers back at my house. After a long examination, he finally speaks.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“From this point forward, this is your new life,” he said in a vigorous voice, “Welcome to camp, and I expect everyone in top working conditions. If anyone disobeys an order…” he fires a bullet up in the air. “If anyone tries to escape…” another bullet was fired. “If anyone disrespects us…” a third bullet was fired.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">He keeps on doing this until he ran out of bullets to fire. He then went back to the hut that he was in and from the soldiers; we received a pair of black shirts and black pants with different numbers on each pair indicating that we were all prisoners. Afterwards, everyone was even more frightened that they didn’t make a single sound, especially me.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">Right off the bat, we’ve already started working in the fields wearing “uniform”. During the long work hours, I’ve witnessed many people suffering, dying, and all I could do was ignore and keep on working. At night, when most of us try to sleep, more captured people were sent here but they weren’t here to work, they were here to be executed.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">January 1979, four long years of my life had passed in this death camp. Nothing really changed for the time being, except the fact that the dead bodies were stacked all over the fields, making it harder for us to work. At the time, it was all hopeless for everybody.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">Suddenly, as I was working in the field as always, gun shots were fired but it wasn’t at the field. In my surprise, it turns out that the gun shots were coming from outside the camp. For what I can see, the Khmer Rouge was firing at the Resistance. For us prisoners, we were panicking a bit, hoping for the best outcome possible.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">The fighting has stopped, and we look to see who won. In the end, the Resistances claims victorious and as they enter in the camp, big trucks with the Red Cross symbol came along with them. All the prisoners and I came rushing to them, in desperate need of their aid.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">We were then transported to a refugee camp where most of the survivors were brought to. In the camp, I tried looking for my family to see if they were lucky enough to make it here, or at least some. Then, a miracle happened.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“Mama, Papa!” I yelled in the distances.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“Huh? That voice… it sounds like Sophal!”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“Sophal, can it be?” said mother.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">“It’s him! It’s him!” Dolly cried.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">They all looked at me and made the face of pure relief with a smile, which is something I’ve never seen from my time in the death camp. I immediately rush to them, giving them most loving hug possible. We all fell to the ground in tears of joy, arms wrapped all over me.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">From that point forward, the next thing I knew was that my entire family and I are now immigrants to the United State, the Land of Opportunity, in hopes of receiving a better life and future. We were truly lucky enough to survive all the horrors we have witnessed. We were grateful.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Ready Player One in the English Curriculum</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent"><i>Ready Player One</i>, a novel by Ernest Cline, should be part of the English curriculum for public schools because of the relevancy the book has to offer. Ready Player One is an interesting book to read for those who understand pop-culture references, which is more likely to get the attention of teens and the newer generation. In addition, Ready Player One is a story that anyone could relate to in a sense of escapism, the seeking of distraction from unpleasant times. Books that are currently used in the public education system don’t have the same level of interest towards the newer generations and teens for they are “too old” and “too boring”. Ready Player One is a fresh, original novel filled with excitement, adventure, and pop-culture references that would absolutely get the attention of not only teens, but a vast majority of people in the new generation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">The novel is interesting for the new generation to read because older books, such as Shakespeare, Edger Allen Poe, etc., doesn’t have the same effect towards them. The plot of <i>Ready Player One</i> is enough to get the attention of many teens and they would love to read the whole novel. “Halliday was the videogame designer responsible for creating the OASIS, a massively multiplayer online game that had gradually evolved into the globally networked virtual reality most of humanity now used on a daily basis.” (Cline 0) The words “videogame” and “virtual reality” would immediately catch the attention of many because of the technology we have today. In our current generation, video games are now a major part of many people’s lives, especially teenagers, and virtual reality is now a hot topic in our society. <i>Ready Player One</i> would most certainly be read and loved by many people of the current generation and possibly those in the future.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">Unlike most novels, <i>Ready Player One</i> portray the topic of escapism, the seeking of entertainment or fantasy from the harsh realities. In today’s society, many people rely on escapism as a way to sooth themselves from how cruel reality could be. Many people today suffer from depression, anxiety, and anger and escapism is their way to keep them stable mentally, especially teenagers. “I’d come to see my rig for what it was: an elaborate contraption for deceiving my senses, to allow me to live in a world that didn’t exist.” (Cline 198) Everyone has experienced escapism is some form of way and it’s not their fault in doing so. As human beings, we seek comfort in times of distress. <i>Ready Player One</i> discuss how and what escapism could be and many people of the current generation would absolutely understand that topic of the book.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">The novel itself is fresh and original, which is very relevant to today’s society. Ready Player One holds a lot of pop-culture references which is aimed towards nerds and geeks, but it could it be understood by regular people alike. Anybody from today’s society would understand the many allusions the book has to offer and it would make them excited to read something that they would most likely enjoy. “OASIS was much more than a game or an entertainment platform.” (Cline 34) The whole plot of the story is filled with excitement, adventure, and relevancy towards the current generation, making the novel more appealing towards them. <i>Ready Player One</i> is a novel met for our time.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent">Ernest Cline’s best-selling book, <i>Ready Player One</i>, should be part of the public education system because of the relevancy and enjoyment it has to offer for students and other alike. Ready Player One is an interesting novel to read, whether to the young or old, for it contains fantasy and excitement anyone can enjoy. It tackles the topic of escapism, which is extremely a relevant topic in our society. Anyone can relate to the book in any form for way and it contains illusions that the majority of today’s society would understand. <i>Ready Player One</i> is an absolute wonder to read and public schools should implement this in the English curriculum.</p>
