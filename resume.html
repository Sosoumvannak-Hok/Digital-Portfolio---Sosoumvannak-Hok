                    <br>
                    <p>My name is Katie McQuone and I am the Video Production Academy Coordinator at Sunnyside High School in Fresno, California. I am writing to give my recommendation to Sosoumvannak Hok for a game design internship with your company. Sosoumvannak was a student in my class last year but being the coordinator of the academy I have had plenty of contact with him this year as well.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are close to fifty students in the junior class of our academy and Sosoumvannak has led his class with the highest grade point average for going on two years. Last year he won two awards in my class for videos that he produced, one being a video where he demonstrated his ability to match cut and another for “sweding” the movie “Rush Hour.” His attention to detail, ability to follow directions and how quickly he picks up new tasks make him a dream student and someone you would not want to pass up for this employment opportunity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I have no reservations when giving my highest recommendation to Sosoumvannak for the internship position with your company. Although he is great at video, his true passion is in gaming and the chance to work with you would be the perfect start to what I know will be a long successful career in your industry. You will not regret the decision to bring him on board; any company would be lucky to get an employee as kind and trustworthy as Sosoumvannak. If you have any other questions please feel free to contact me at kaitlan.mcquone@fresnounified.org or call 559-349-1576.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>To whom it my concern,</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am writing this letter on behalf of Sosoumvannak Hok, a former student of mine from the 2016-2017 school year. Sosoumvannak was in my tenth grade GATE English class and was an exceptional member of our learning environment.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Throughout my time knowing Sosoumvannak, I have seen him grow as both a student and an individual whom aims to contribute to society in a meaningful way. He is not only determined to excel in an academic setting, but is also motivated to pursue his passions, hobbies, and life goals. These traits have created a well-rounded student and person that I can confidently endorse in his pursuit of obtaining the Game Design Internship. Sosoumvannak’s experiences both at Sunnyside and on his own have prepared him to benefit from an internship such as this.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When Sosoumvannak was in my class, he was a team player and was able to work with group members to complete a finished project. Sosoumvannak is a responsible leader, both academically and socially. His drive for excellence and success is backed by his impressive work ethic as well as his desire to see others succeed around him. He therefore works hard to master knowledge and skills so that he can further explain and teach to those around him. This can also be seen through his thorough knowledge of programs, such as Adobe Premiere and Photoshop, as well as software like Brackets and Unity Game Engine. Sosoumvannak’s impressive accomplishments further speak to his abilities to not only learn, but also excel in what he puts his mind to.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Furthermore, Sosoumvannak thinks on both an academic and creative platform. He is able to use the knowledge and skills learned in an educational environment and further apply them on a creative level. I witnessed the marriage of both academics and creativity through a variety of projects in both mine and the Video Production Academy courses. For these reasons, Sosoumvannak is an ideal candidate in pursuing and mastering web and software design. I have no doubt that Sosoumvannak is an excellent candidate for the internship. His personality, passion, and creativity are well suited for this opportunity, for he would be an asset to any team or group. If you have any further questions about Sosoumvannak, please feel free to reach me through my e-mail.</p>
